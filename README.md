# Odin-Landing-Page
Learning project for designing a webpage based on given specifications.

Build the web page from an image of a webpage design and a color template and a list of fonts.

Skills used include html and css, especially relying on flexboxes.

After applying the general webpage design, elements were changed to make the webpage more polished with different content.

The altered webpage represents the landing page to a nature preservation organization's website. The links on the landing page lead to additional html files representing related webpages.
